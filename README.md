# Website_SILL
 Website for Free Illustration Downloads, using Django, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, with MySQL
 The website allows users to download 2D and 3D illustrations, along with icons, for free. The project was built using Django, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, with MySQL used for data storage to ensure efficient management of graphic assets.
 I was solely responsible for the UI/UX design, as well as the implementation of both the front-end and back-end. The website was inspired by several platforms available online.
